# DataStorage

> *This class is intended to provide an abstract interface for a robust data
> storage pattern in which data is stored locally on one or more clients as well
> as remotely in a single server data file. Clients regularly synchronize their
> data files with the one on the server, and thereby indirectly with one
> another.*

**Note:** *This class was initially developed as part of the **MealPlan**
project, starting on November 25th, 2018. On March 3rd, 2019, it was extracted
into its own PhpStorm project. A Git repository was initialized and a
documentation set was configured using **JSDoc**.*
